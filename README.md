# Camcam

This repository contains 2 things:

- a script that you can deploy on your Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera and a PanTiltHat from Pimoroni. Is is located in `/server`

- an XCode project that compiles for iOS and controls both servos from iOS.

The iOS project has a hardwired address on which the device will seek the MJPG stream and call APIs to pan and tilt.
